/* style.css */
/* CSS is an acronym for 'Cascading StyleSheets'. It is a language made for one thing: Making HTML look good. If CSS didn't
exist, I doubt HTML would. Anyway, I (Heliox) am your guide! I will explain all of the CSS in this project. (In case you're
wondering, this text is something call a 'comment', and it goes in between the stars and slashes.) */
